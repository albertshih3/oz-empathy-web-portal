This is the web administration portal for the Oakland Zoo Empathy Guide mobile application. This is an interal facing website.

## How was it built?

The website was build used the NextJS framework. I also used:

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) - customizable components for the site
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - backend services for authentication and databases (same as app)
